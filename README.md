# Cat Longevity Diagnostics
Improving the diagnosis of age-related diseases in cats using blood RNA-seq (ONT-based) in combination with functional measurements such as activity levels (cat pedometers).

The analysis pipeline (example code & example data) will be pushed to this repository as we go along. There's a number of measurements we'd be interested in, including the BiT age transcriptomic algo, which was tested on very few samples from GTEX in the public analysis folder.
